## Introduction of MCM/ICM
**MCM** : the Mathematical Contest in Modeling, while **ICM** : the Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling. Sponsors of MCM/ICM (same famous associations) : MAA, SIAM, INFORMS, ASA, AMS, Two SIGMA.


**COMAP**'s Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM) and Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (ICM) are international contests for high school students and college undergraduates. The contests challenge teams of up to three students to analyze, model, solve, and present solution reports to an open-ended application problem. In these contests research, analytics, and applied intelligence reign along with less-quantifiable factors like timing and luck.


Contest teams of up to three students address one of the following six problems choices over the period of the contest weekend :

1. MCM Problem A (continuous)
2. MCM Problem B (discrete) (our team chose it for the **discrete optimization and simulation**)
3. MCM Problem C (data insights)
4. ICM Problem D (operations research/network science)
5. ICM Problem E (sustainability)
6. ICM Problem F (policy)


Duration of MCM/ICM : about 96 hours (4 days)
Deliverable : An academic paper (20-25 pages), codes (maybe)


The results of the MCM/ICM in 2022 (only for the Outstanding Winner):
| Problem | total number of the teams |number of the Outstanding Winner | Rate |
| :------------: | :------------: | :------------: | :------------: |
| A | 2883 | 7 | 0.24% |
| B | 2179 | 6 | 0.27% |
| C | 10043 | 10 | 0.10% |
| D | 955  | 4 | 0.42% |
| E | 8181 | 10 | 0.12% |
| F | 2964 | 7 | 0.24% |


## Preparation for the contest
### Team amd meamates
1. Common characteristics of the three teammates
	- Good understanding and application of basic mathematical knowledge ( (Partial) Differential Equations, Probability and Statistics, Matrix Operations, Numerical Operations, Game Theory, Graph Theory, Optimization Theory, Machine Learning, Data Mining, etc.)
	- Fast learning, self-learning, attitude of keeping improving
	- **Motivation**, **ambition**
	- **Teamwork**, **team communication** (project experience)
	- Ability to read and draft/write papers	 (**research experience**), high English level (CET-6 520+). **Research experience** is very important !
	- An **excellent leader** (one is enough)

2. Combinations of the teammates (majors)
Here are some combinations about the majors which I recomend :
	- Mathematics (applied) + Big Data (Python or Matlab) + Other
	- Mathematics (applied) + Finance  + Other (Python or Matlab)
	- Mathematics (applied) + Management  + Other (Python or Matlab)
	- Mathematics (applied) + Communication Engineering (Python or Matlab) + Other
We note that most students in CS (computer sci) are excellent in C++, Java, html, etc., but may not be good at data processing and analysing. You have to check it.  **: )**

4. Schedule to evaluate and improve your nice team
	1. You having some experience in these contest, I recommend that you find your teamates and build your team before the beginning of summer vacation (July), considering a small mathematical contest in modeling in August which coulde be a small test or an evaluation about the modeling abilities of your team.
	2. If you join also the Contemporary Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling (CUMCM) in September, you have to evaluate your teamates for the next cooperation during and after CUMCM. After the Contemporary Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling (CUMCM).
	3. It is strongly recommended that, you have to organize 1 to 5  **mock contests** **consciously**, in which you slove one of the past year MCM/ICM problems during the weekend or the vacation (in 96 hours).
	4. After the mock contests, it is needed to submit the paper to your supervisor/tutor to **aquire the  feedbacks** accordingly, based on which you revise and refine your preparation plans.
	5. Earlier, I mentioned a good ability to read papers. That's because that's what I asked my team to do in the first place : set a time limit (a week also) to read a famous paper, dissect it (goals, methods, innovation, structure of the paper, etc.), and show it to my teammates.


## Knowledge in Optimization
Here, I would like to share one part of my notes for the preparation, which takes me a lot of time to translate it in English and write it in ".mk" (The word count of the original notes is 10k+). Ah, suffering.
### Planning Model
1. **Linear programming model**
	1. Decision variables, slack variables, residual variables
	2. `[x, fval] = linprog(c, A, b, Aeq, beq, VLB, VUB, x0)`
2. Graphical method (unreliable)
3. (Mixed) Integer Programming Models
	1. Extreme point test (basically useless because there are too many variables)
	2. Pruning method/branch and bound method (reduce the domain of definition according to the value of the objective function), the relaxation problem needs to be determined
	3. 0-1 integer programming
		1. `[x, fval] = intlinprog(f, intcon, A, b, Aeq, beq, VLB, VUB)`
		2. intcon~ the serial number of the variable whose definition domain is an integer
4. Assignment problems (assigning different people to do different things): can be used to search for permutations
	1. Hungarian assignment method (HA) (complexity O(n^3))
	2. Ones Assignment Method(OAM)
5. Goal Planning Model
	1. Sequential algorithm (according to the order of priority, the objective programming problem is decomposed into a series of single-objective programming problems, and then solved in sequence)
		1. Set the deviation variable (difference between actual value and target value)
		2. Unified processing of goals and constraints (hard constraints, soft constraints)
		3. Set the priority and weight coefficient of the target (set the priority first, then set the weight)
	2. Multi-objective planning
		1. Pareto efficient solution method
			1. Calculate the respective optimal solutions for different objective functions
			2. Construct high-dimensional rectangles from these solutions and divide them equally, and the corresponding objective function values are their weights.
			3. `[x fval] = fgoalattain(fun, x0, goal, weight, A, b, Aeq, beq, lb, ub, nonlcon)`
				1. weight~ the weight of multiple objective functions (need to explain)
				2. nonlcon ~ constraint function [c; ceq]
		2. Priority method
		3. Constrained Model Approach
			1. For part of the objective function, we only need it to be less than a reasonable value
			2. Sensitivity analysis of linear models
			3. Parametric Linear Programming
				1. Linear programming problem with parameters in the objective function (simplex method)
				2. Constrained constants contain parameters of linear programming problems
			4. Stochastic Linear Programming Model
				1. Expected value model method (do not know the variance, and the probability of being the optimal solution is not high)
					1. Convexity Theorem (if the formula is convex, the expectation is also convex)
				2. Chance Constraint Model Approach
					1. Equivalent properties
					2. Use the upper quantile fraction to simplify and solve
					3. Alpha reliability linear programming
					4. Disadvantage: The equivalent form of this formula is uncertain, and it is not necessarily linear programming, and the simplex method cannot be used to solve the optimal solution.
6. Dual planning problem
	1.The right-hand side of the constraints & the coefficients of the objective function are all random variables
	2. Process the constraints, then dual, then use the distribution law and the upper quantile, and finally return the dual
	3. Deterministic programming of normal stochastic programming and its sensitivity analysis
		1. Reliable linear programming of normal stochastic programming
		2. Normal random programming sensitivity analysis
			1. Estimate the effect of bias on the optimal basis
			2. Estimate the influence of the bias value on the optimal value

7. Second-order mathematical programming model with simple compensation
	1. The deterministic equivalence class of the model
8. Relevant Opportunity Planning Model Approach
9. **Nonlinear programming model**
	1. General type (it is difficult to achieve a global optimal solution. If it is a convex function, it must be a global optimal solution)
	2. `x = fmincon(fun, x0, A, b, Aeq, beq, VLB, VUB, nonlcon, options)`
	3. Secondary planning
		1. `[x, fval]=quadprog(H, f, A, b, Aeq, beq, VLB, VUB, x0, options)`
	4. MATLAB solution of constrained extreme values
		1. Optimizing a univariate function
			1. `[x, fval]=fminbnd('fun', x1, x2, options)`
			2. `fminimax()`
			3. `x = fseminf('fun', x0, ntheta, seminfcon, A, b, Aeq, beq,lb,ub)`
			4. seminfcon ~ semi-infinite constraint function that constrains +c(x)+ceq(x) by semi-infinite constraint variables and functions
			5. ntheta ~ the number of semi-infinite constraints
		2. optimtool toolbox interface operation
	5. (External) Penalty Function Method - Unconstrained Minimization Technique SUMT (Constrained Problems Converted into a Series of Unconstrained Problems)
	6. Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) method (Approximate the objective function with a quadratic function at each step of the iteration, and approximate the general constraints with linear constraints)

### Equation Solving Algorithm (for Points Zero)
1. Ridders algorithm
2. Inverse quadratic interpolation trial position algorithm (usually no more than three times)
4. Tikhonov regularization or ridge regression (optimizing quadratic terms)
	1. The noise is white Gaussian noise, so there is least squares.
	2. Output: get a smooth image
5. LASSO problem and its deformation (make the independent variable x as sparse as possible, feature extraction of x)
6. Matrix separation (robust PCA) (separate the matrix M into a low-rank matrix X and a sparse matrix S. Remove the noise in the original data to the greatest extent, and find the best projection of the data on the low-dimensional space. )

### Graphs and Networks
1. Shortest path
	1. (undirected graph) adjacency matrix (symmetric matrix, degree=sum()) (when the number of edges of the graph is much smaller than the number of vertices, the adjacency matrix representation will cause a lot of waste of space)
	2. Dijkstra's algorithm (the method of generating the shortest path in the order of increasing path length, the priority queue optimization method is used for sparse graph)
